MarathiCursive font
===================

'MarathiCursive' is a Unicode Modi script font.  Modi is the shorthand script
which was used to write Marathi language, which is spoken in Maharashtra,
western India.

As of version 1.0a, Graphite-enabled version of MarathiCursive font,
'MarathiCursiveG' is included in Package.

As of version 2.0, this is a Unicode font.  Previous versions of this font
used Devanagari codepoints in order to be rendered.

Limitations:
Modi script has some intersyllabic ligatures, but OpenType renderer might not
support them, or even regular Indic ligatures.  You may want to use
'MarathiCursiveG' under applications with Graphite support such as LibreOffice.
