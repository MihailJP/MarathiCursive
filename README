MarathiCursive font
===================

'MarathiCursive' is a Modi script font which uses OpenType feature for Deva-
nagari.  This font shows Modi script instead of Devanagari.  Modi is the
shorthand script which was used to write Marathi language, which is spoken in
Maharashtra, western India.

Limitations:
Under Windows OS (with UniScribe), it requires a ZWJ between a certain letter
and following 'ra' in order to show intersyllabic ligatures.
