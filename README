MarathiCursive font
===================

'MarathiCursive' is a Modi script font which uses OpenType feature for Deva-
nagari.  This font shows Modi script instead of Devanagari.  Modi is the
shorthand script which was used to write Marathi language, which is spoken in
Maharashtra, western India.

As of version 1.0a, Graphite-enabled version of MarathiCursive font,
'MarathiCursiveG' is included in Package.

Limitations:
Under Windows OS (with UniScribe), some intersyllabic ligatures cannot be
shown.  You may need to use 'MarathiCursiveG' under applications with Graphite
support such as LibreOffice.
